Generics in Java is a feature that allows classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on multiple types without compromising type safety. In other words, it provides a way to write reusable code that can work with different data types.

Generics are implemented using parameterized types. A parameterized type is a class or interface that accepts one or more type parameters. These type parameters can be used to declare the type of the arguments, return types, and variables used within the class or interface.

Here's an example of a generic class in Java:
public class MyGenericClass<T> {
   private T value;

   public MyGenericClass(T value) {
      this.value = value;
   }

   public T getValue() {
      return value;
   }

   public void setValue(T value) {
      this.value = value;
   }
}
In this example, the class MyGenericClass is parameterized by a type parameter T. This means that the class can work with any type of object, as long as it is provided as an argument to the class when it is instantiated.

Here's an example of how to use this class:
MyGenericClass<String> stringObj = new MyGenericClass<>("Hello, World!");
System.out.println(stringObj.getValue()); // Output: Hello, World!

MyGenericClass<Integer> intObj = new MyGenericClass<>(123);
System.out.println(intObj.getValue()); // Output: 123

In this example, we create two instances of MyGenericClass, one for String and one for Integer. We provide the type of object we want to work with as a type argument when we create the instance.

By using generics, we can create reusable code that can work with different types of objects without sacrificing type safety. This can help us write more efficient and maintainable code.
