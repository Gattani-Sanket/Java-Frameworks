//doGet()
In Java servlets, the doGet() method is one of the HTTP-specific methods provided by the HttpServlet class. 
It is called by the servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) to handle HTTP GET requests from clients.
the data is typically appended to the URL as query parameters. 
To access these parameters in your server-side code, you can use the getParameter() method of the HttpServletRequest object.
//Just write doGet insted of service and in html <form action="addition" method="get">


//doPost()
In Java servlets, the doPost() method is one of the HTTP-specific methods provided by the HttpServlet class. 
It is called by the servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) to handle HTTP POST requests from clients.
the data is typically in request body. 
To access these parameters in your server-side code, you can use the getParameter() method of the HttpServletRequest object.
//Just write doPost() insted of service and in html <form action="addition" method="post">
