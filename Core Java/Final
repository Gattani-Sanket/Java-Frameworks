In Java, the "final" keyword can be used to make a variable, method, or class unchangeable or unextendable. 
Here is an overview of how the "final" keyword can be used:

Final variable: A final variable cannot be reassigned after it has been initialized. Its value remains constant throughout the program execution.
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
MAX_VALUE = 200; // This will result in a compilation error.


Final method: A final method cannot be overridden by any subclass. If a method is declared final in a superclass, 
then any subclass must use the same implementation of that method.
public class Parent {
    public final void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Parent");
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent {
    public void printMessage() { // This will result in a compilation error.
        System.out.println("Hello from Child");
    }
}

Final class: A final class cannot be extended by any subclass. If a class is declared final, then it cannot be subclassed.
final public class MyClass {
    // Class implementation
}

public class MySubclass extends MyClass { // This will result in a compilation error.
    // Subclass implementation
}

Using the "final" keyword can provide several benefits, including:

Ensuring that a variable's value remains constant throughout the program execution.
Preventing subclasses from changing the implementation of a method or extending a class.
Optimizing the performance of code by allowing the compiler to make certain assumptions about the behavior of a final entity.
