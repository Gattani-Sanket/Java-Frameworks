static  class OuterClass {
    public void outerMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello from OuterClass");
    }

        outer.outerMethod();

If you try to compile the code you provided, you will receive a compile-time error because you cannot declare a class as static. 
The error message will say something like: "Illegal modifier for the class OuterClass; only public, abstract & final are permitted".

The static keyword is used to define class-level methods and variables that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. 
However, it cannot be used to define a top-level class like OuterClass.

static can only be used with inner class (nested class)
public class OuterClass {
    private int outerVariable = 10;

    public void outerMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello from OuterClass");
    }

    // Non-static inner class
    public class InnerClass {
        public void innerMethod() {
            System.out.println("Hello from InnerClass");
            System.out.println("outerVariable = " + outerVariable);
            outerMethod();
        }
    }

    // Static nested class
    public static class StaticNestedClass {
        public void staticMethod() {
            System.out.println("Hello from StaticNestedClass");
        }
    }
}

In this example, OuterClass contains an instance variable outerVariable and a method outerMethod. It also contains a non-static inner class InnerClass, which has a method innerMethod that accesses the instance variable and method of the enclosing class.

Additionally, OuterClass contains a static nested class StaticNestedClass, which has a method staticMethod that does not have access to the instance variable and method of the enclosing class.

Here's how you can use these classes:
public class AnotherClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the outer class
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();

        // Create an instance of the inner class
        OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();

        // Call the inner class method
        inner.innerMethod();

        // Call the static nested class method
        OuterClass.StaticNestedClass staticNested = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
        staticNested.staticMethod();
    }
}

The output of running the main method of the AnotherClass would be:

Hello from InnerClass
outerVariable = 10
Hello from OuterClass
Hello from StaticNestedClass
